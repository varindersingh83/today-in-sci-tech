Here are 3 wild new things in AI research this week 🧵👇

1. Bandit based Dynamic Candidate Edge Selection in Solving Traveling Salesman Problems
1. This research paper is about a new approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic problem in computer science and operations research where the aim is to find the shortest possible route that covers a number of cities and returns to the origin city. The new approach involves using a technique called a multi-armed bandit model to select and include promising routes that aren't usually considered in traditional algorithms like the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm. This dynamic selection of routes allows the algorithm to avoid getting stuck in sub-optimal solutions and find better, more efficient routes. 

2. This research is important because TSP has applications in a variety of fields, from logistics and transportation to computer science and genetics. By improving the algorithm's ability to find more efficient solutions, it could lead to significant cost and time savings in these fields. The experiment's results not only show the effectiveness of this new technique in solving TSP but also in tackling its variant problems, thereby extending its benefits across a wider range of applications.

3. 📡🚀 New research takes on the classic Traveling Salesman Problem! By bringing in the big guns - multi-armed bandit models - researchers pave the way for smarter, more efficient route-finding. No more getting stuck in traffic jams of sub-optimal solutions! #CodeSmarterNotHarder 🧠🛣️💡

2. PhyX: Does Your Model Have the "Wits" for Physical Reasoning?
1. The research paper introduces PhyX, a new large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate how well artificial intelligence models can reason about physics in visual scenarios. Despite having thousands of carefully created multimodal questions covering various physics subjects like thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and mechanics, the study found that even the most advanced models had a hard time with physical reasoning. The models only achieved an accuracy rate of 32.5% to 45.8%, which is much lower than human experts. The study found that these models heavily relied on memorized knowledge and mathematical formulas, rather than truly understanding the physics. 

2. This research is interesting and important because it evaluates the ability of AI models to reason in a way that is crucial to human intelligence, but often overlooked: physical reasoning. By revealing the significant struggle of even state-of-the-art models with this aspect of intelligence, the study underscores the limitations of current AI technology and highlights the need for development in this area. By understanding these limitations, we can make progress towards creating AI models that can genuinely understand and reason about the physical world, which is essential for many practical applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital assistants.

3. Exploring Flow-Lenia Universes with a Curiosity-driven AI Scientist: Discovering Diverse Ecosystem Dynamics
1. What it says (in plain English): This research paper details a method for using AI to explore and understand the complex, evolving dynamics of a system known as Flow-Lenia, which is a type of continuous cellular automaton (imagine a grid where each cell evolves based on the state of its neighboring cells). The AI, driven by an innate 'curiosity', seeks out diverse and interesting dynamics within the system. It's not just looking for individual patterns, but also large environments where different patterns interact with each other. The team used this AI to conduct two experiments, finding that it could reveal a greater variety of dynamics than a random search would. The researchers also developed an interactive tool to allow humans to work alongside the AI, partnering in scientific exploration.

2. Why it's interesting or important: This research is significant because it demonstrates a new way to use AI to investigate and understand complex systems. It's not just about automated discovery, but also about creating a collaborative workflow between AI and humans. This approach could be applied to other complex, parameterizable systems, opening up the possibility for new insights into how these systems work and evolve. It could be particularly useful in fields like ecology, economics, or even astrophysics, where understanding emergent properties and collective behaviors can be crucial.

3. A catchy tweet-style hook with emojis: 🤖 Meet the AI scientist with curiosity! It's exploring the complexities of digital universes, uncovering secrets of evolving ecosystems 🌌, and helping us humans join in on the discovery! #AIScience #FutureOfResearch 🔬👩‍💻🧠🚀
